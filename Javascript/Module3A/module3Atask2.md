# Fun Facts about JavaScript

**Not related to Java:** Despite the name, JavaScript has no direct relation to the Java programming language. It was created in 10 days and originally named "Mocha" by its creator, Brendan Eich in May 1995. It was later renamed to JavaScript as a marketing strategy because everyone knew JAVA at the time.

**Quick Development:** JavaScript is often considered a "high-level" language, meaning it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. This makes it a great choice for quick development.

**Client-Side Scripting:** While JavaScript is a general-purpose programming language, it is widely known for its use in web development. It is primarily used as a client-side scripting language to make web pages interactive. Approximately 94% of all websites use JavaScript. It is also the only programming language that can run natively in web browsers.

**Event-Driven:** JavaScript uses an event-driven programming paradigm. This means that the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (clicks, keypresses) or system events.

**First-Class Functions:** JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.

**Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language that allows variables to change types during runtime. This provides flexibility but can lead to certain types of errors if not managed properly.

**Popular Frameworks:** Several popular frameworks and libraries are built on top of JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue for front-end development, and Node.js for server-side JavaScript.

**JSON:** JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a common format for data exchange between a server and a web application.
